Reverse Supply Chain Optimizer
ðŸ“¦ Project Overview
The Reverse Supply Chain Optimizer is an end-to-end machine learning solution designed to:

Predict product returns

Estimate return costs

Optimize reverse logistics

Manage returned inventory

This pipeline helps businesses minimize losses and improve operational efficiency in handling returned products.

ðŸ§© Project Phases
ðŸ”¹ Phase 1: Product Return Prediction
Goal: Predict the likelihood of a product being returned

Model: XGBoost Classifier

Output: Return probability (0 or 1)

Artifacts: xgb_model.pkl, scaler.pkl

ðŸ”¹ Phase 2: Return Cost Estimation
Goal: Estimate the cost associated with a product return

Model: XGBoost Regressor

Output: Predicted return cost

Artifacts: xgb_cost_model.pkl

ðŸ”¹ Phase 3: Reverse Logistics Optimization
Goal: Optimize the selection of return centers based on cost and distance

Method: Rule-based logic and optimization heuristics

Output: Best return center location

ðŸ”¹ Phase 4: Inventory Optimization
Goal: Decide what to do with returned items (restock, refurbish, dispose)

Method: Decision rules based on condition, demand, and return cost

Output: Inventory action recommendation

ðŸ”¹ Phase 5: Integrated Pipeline
Goal: Provide a unified Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the full system

Notebook: 05_integrated_pipeline.ipynb

Features:

Load models

Predict return

Estimate cost

Run logistics and inventory modules
